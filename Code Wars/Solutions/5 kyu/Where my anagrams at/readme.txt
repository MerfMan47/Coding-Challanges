This one was suprisingly easy. Due to the fact that
anagrams do not need to be in order allowed me to
simply sort both arrays and compare them using JSON
data, then if they were identical add the item to the
returned array.
========================Notes========================

What is an anagram? Well, two words are anagrams of each other if they both contain the same letters. For example:

'abba' & 'baab' == true

'abba' & 'bbaa' == true

'abba' & 'abbba' == false

'abba' & 'abca' == false
Write a function that will find all the anagrams of a word from a list. You will be given two inputs a word and an array with words. You should return an array of all the anagrams or an empty array if there are none. For example:

anagrams('abba', ['aabb', 'abcd', 'bbaa', 'dada']) => ['aabb', 'bbaa']

anagrams('racer', ['crazer', 'carer', 'racar', 'caers', 'racer']) => ['carer', 'racer']

anagrams('laser', ['lazing', 'lazy',  'lacer']) => []
Note for Go
For Go: Empty string slice is expected when there are no anagrams found.
