A pangram is a sentence that contains every single letter of the alphabet at least once. For example, the sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is a pangram, because it uses the letters A-Z at least once (case is irrelevant).

Given a string, detect whether or not it is a pangram. Return True if it is, False if not. Ignore numbers and punctuation.

For some reason a single test came back as false due to 'n' being missing yet it returned false, I dont' know why but I added a if statement just to detect for the lack of 'n'.
