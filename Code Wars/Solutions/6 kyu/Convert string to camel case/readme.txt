=====================Notes=====================
Honestly I'm pretty tired so I'll make this quick
I seperated the string into an array then capitalized
anything that followed a specific character then
shoved the string back together.

Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).

Examples
"the-stealth-warrior" gets converted to "theStealthWarrior"
"The_Stealth_Warrior" gets converted to "TheStealthWarrior"
